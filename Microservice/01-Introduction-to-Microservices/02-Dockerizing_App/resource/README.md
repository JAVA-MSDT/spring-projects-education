## Dockerizing steps

> There are 2 docker compose files
> docker-compose under src/docker you need to run it first to guruntee that the build will be success due to Hibernate
> checking during the build.
> docker-compose which is in the root you will run it after you have build your project, because it has the
> configuration of the newtwork where postgreSQL will run first then the reource image

### Steps to successfully run the application in docker mode.

* Run docker-compose under src/docker.
    * The reason for this step is becuase during the run Hibernate will ckeck that there is a connection between the
      application and the database.
    * So this step is mendatory to build a docker image for the resource application, then later you can build a
      container from that image locally or push to the hub.
* Package the application using maven tab in your IDEA or CMD command `mvn clean package`
* You should now find a jar file under target/
* Stop and delete the docker container which you have run from docker-compose under src/docker.
    * This step is important to avoid the port in use conflict.
* Run docker-compose under the root.
* now you should have your application running successfully and you can interact with it.
* For more info about the application please check the application resource folder (application-docker.properties)
* You can add more configuration or changing the anything in the application source code then repeat the above steps to
  build a new image from the application.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker exiting

* resource application docker will stop runing if you you have build the image several times, because of the old image
  will be in use.
* To avoid that, any change you do related to docker image or the application, delete the image to guarantee a new clean
  image.
